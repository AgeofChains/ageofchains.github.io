TODO

- overview of project
- team page : need pictures, bios, social links
- card sale section with live card sale counters
- homepage : rotation of card illustrations every 7 seconds (change from 4)
- add favicon
- configure twitter bot posting from slack

Also, I feel there is too much stuff happening on the left side. All the text above "Learn More" Can be replaced by "Blockchain based Trading Card Game"


And let us replace "Learn More" with "Participate" and link it to the BCT-Thread
